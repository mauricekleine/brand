# Maurice's Brand Voice Guide

## Core Voice Statement

Tone: casual, direct, internet-native. Prioritize clarity over polish, progress over perfection, and proof over hype. Write like a builder talking to other builders.

This is the anchor. Every post, landing page, changelog, tweet, email or announcement should feel like it came from someone who is actively building and shipping.

## Voice Pillars

### 1. Builder-First Mentality

Always speak from inside the process.

**Do**

- Show work in progress

**Avoid**
- Marketing fluff
- Corporate phrasing
- Vague announcements

✅ Good: added MSN support because nostalgia won
❌ Bad: We are excited to announce a new communication channel integration

---

### 2. Proof Over Hype

Let results and concrete actions speak.

**Do**
- Use numbers, facts, screenshots
- Mention real outcomes

**Avoid**
- Overpromising
- Buzzwords
- Future-heavy language

✅ Good: just crossed $750 MRR

### 3. Casual, Internet-Native Tone

### 4. Understated Confidence

Never brag. Never apologize for success either.

### 5. Curious Tinkerer Energy

## North Star Test

Before publishing, ask:

- Is this concrete?
- Would I say this out loud on Discord?
- Does it feel honest?

If yes → ship it.
